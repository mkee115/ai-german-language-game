# ai-german-language-game
An AI-integrated game for English speakers to practice/learn German

## Project Size

**Current Status:** This project is very small at the moment (~200KB total, ~30KB without git history).

The repository currently contains:
- Basic project structure with placeholder directories (backend, frontend, models, prompts)
- Initial documentation
- 6 files total

As development progresses, the size will grow depending on:
- AI model integration (if models are included locally vs. API-based)
- Frontend assets (images, sounds, etc.)
- Dependencies installed via package managers (not tracked in git)
- Backend implementation and database files

**Storage Requirements:**
- **To clone:** ~200KB
- **After installing dependencies:** TBD (project is in planning phase)

## Why I chose to make this
I currently am trying to learn German. I would love to make something that involves language learning, since this goes towards my German study but also can be used for others, and, possibly later on, can be expanded to other languages. 
My career plans are to go into an AI pathway. I am very interested in AI and would like to have practical LLM experience for my future career. 
I chose to make this game as it integrates both becoming a model of a large language and large language models (pun intended :smirk:)

## Initial plan
Although my initial plan is very weak, I aim to make my plan as I work towards my project. Currently, I only have the idea of what I want to do, although not too sure on how to do it.
